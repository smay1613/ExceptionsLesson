Write a program that converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time. The following is a sample dialogue:

Enter time in 24-hour notation:
13:07

That is the same as 1:07 PM Again?(y/n)
y

Enter time in 24-hour notation:
10:15
That is the same as 10:15 AM Again?(y/n)
y

Enter time in 24-hour notation:
10:65

There is no such time as 10:65
Try again:
Enter time in 24-hour notation:

16:05
That is the same as 4:05 PM
Again?(y/n)
n
End of program

You will define an exception class called TimeFormatMistake. 
If the user enters an illegal time, like 10:65 or even gibberish like 8&*68, then your program will throw and catch a TimeFormatMistake.
